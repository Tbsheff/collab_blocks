# Product Requirements Document (PRD) – CollabBlocks

*Version 0.1 – April 16 2025*

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision
CollabBlocks provides **drop‑in real‑time collaboration infrastructure**—presence, CRDT storage, comments, notifications, AI copilots, and offline sync—so product teams can ship multiplayer web apps in days instead of months. We aim to offer **sub‑25 ms global latency**, SOC 2‑grade security, and a best‑in‑class developer experience to become the de‑facto “Stripe for real‑time collaboration.”

## 2. Problem Statement
Building low‑latency, conflict‑free collaboration requires deep expertise in WebSockets, distributed systems, CRDTs, scaling, and compliance. Start‑ups and SMBs lack resources to build and maintain this stack; enterprise engineers face long security & compliance cycles. Existing solutions (Firebase, Ably) either lack CRDT semantics or enterprise compliance.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics
| Goal | Metric | Target (12 mo post‑GA) |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| Developer Adoption | SDK installs / wk | 4 k / wk |
| Usage | Weekly active connections | 250 k |
| Revenue | ARR | \$2 M |
| Performance | p95 RTT (NA/EU) | ≤ 40 ms |
| Reliability | Uptime (rolling 30 d) | ≥ 99.95 % |
| Customer Satisfaction | NPS | ≥ 55 |

## 4. Target Customers & Personas
* **Indie makers & early‑stage startups** – Want to add live cursors & comments with minimal backend work.
* **Product‑led SaaS teams** – Need collaborative text, whiteboard, or data grid features to stay competitive.
* **Enterprise platform teams** – Require SOC 2 T2 / HIPAA, multi‑region data residency, and SLAs.

## 5. Competitive Landscape
| Vendor | Strengths | Gaps CollabBlocks Exploits |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Liveblocks | Mature SDKs, strong DX | Limited AI, US‑only data residency |
| Firebase | Realtime DB, auth | No CRDT, EU latency, no HIPAA |
| Ably | Global edge WS | No storage/CRDT, DIY presence |
| Pusher | Easy channels | No persistence, no compliance |

## 6. Scope
### 6.1 In‑Scope Features (v1‑GA)
1. Presence API (live cursors, avatars, metadata)  
2. Realtime Storage (CRDT: LiveList, LiveMap, LiveObject)  
3. Broadcast channel & threaded comments  
4. Notifications (in‑app + external)  
5. Monitoring dashboard & DevTools extension  
6. AI Copilots (private beta)  
7. Version history (private beta)  
8. Offline sync (experimental)  
9. Compliance: SOC 2 T2, HIPAA (BAA)  
10. SDKs: React, Tiptap, Node, Webhooks

### 6.2 Out of Scope (v1)
* Native mobile SDKs (iOS / Android)  
* On‑premise deployment  
* End‑to‑end encrypted rooms (future research)

## 7. Functional Requirements
| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR‑01 | Users can join a “room” and see others’ cursors & avatars in ≤ 100 ms. | P0 |
| FR‑02 | Client CRDT operations must converge across ≥ 10 k concurrent users with no conflicts. | P0 |
| FR‑03 | Comments support nested replies, reactions, @mentions, and real‑time updates. | P1 |
| FR‑04 | Notifications are delivered in‑app instantly and externally within 2 s. | P1 |
| FR‑05 | AI Copilot can suggest text blocks and apply changes via `mutateStorage`. | P2 |
| FR‑06 | DevTools extension reveals live Storage & Presence data for the dev’s current room. | P1 |
| FR‑07 | Dashboard graphs active connections, ops/s, storage bytes with 1 min granularity. | P1 |
| FR‑08 | Offline clients reconcile and merge ops within 500 ms of reconnection. | P2 |
| FR‑09 | System logs every data mutation with immutable audit trail. | P0 |
| FR‑10 | Provide REST & webhook APIs for server‑side integration. | P0 |

## 8. Non‑Functional Requirements
* **Performance** – p95 RTT ≤ 40 ms NA/EU, ≤ 80 ms globally.
* **Scalability** – 100 k concurrent users per region, 10 M ops/day.
* **Availability** – ≥ 99.95 % (Pro), 99.99 % (Enterprise).
* **Security** – SOC 2 T2, HIPAA, SSO (SAML/OIDC), data at rest encrypted (AES‑256).
* **Internationalization** – Dashboard & docs in EN (v1), add ES/FR (v2).

## 9. User Experience & Design Principles
* **Invisible infrastructure** – 2 lines to connect SDK, sensible defaults.
* **Live‑first UI** – Real‑time feedback (cursors, typing indicators) for perceived speed.
* **Progressive disclosure** – Basic Presence free; advanced blocks (comments, AI) gated by plan.
* **Developer‑centric docs** – Copy‑paste code samples, interactive sandboxes.

## 10. Metrics & Analytics
* **Activation funnel** – Sign‑up → npm install → first room connection.
* **Realtime metrics** – Active connections, ops/s, storage bytes, notif‑events.
* **Business metrics** – MRR, churn, ARPU.

## 11. Milestones & Timeline (see Build Phases)
| Milestone | Date | Key Exit Criteria |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| M0 – Tech spike | Jun 1 2025 | RTT ≤ 50 ms @ 5 k conns |
| M1 – Alpha | Aug 15 2025 | Two‑user demo, unit tests 80 % |
| M2 – Beta | Nov 30 2025 | 100 pilot users, SLA 99.9 % |
| M3 – GA | Mar 30 2026 | Public launch, Stripe billing |
| M4 – Enterprise | Jun 30 2026 | HIPAA, SLA 99.99 % |

## 12. Stakeholders
* **Executive Sponsor** – CEO
* **Head of Product** – Tyler (acting)
* **Engineering Leads** – FE, BE, Platform, AI
* **Security Officer**, **QA Manager**, **Growth Manager**

## 13. Open Questions
1. Which LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic) will be supported at GA?  
2. Acceptable pricing model for notifications (per event vs bundled)?  
3. IndexedDB size limits for offline cache across browsers?  
4. EU data residency timeline—v1 or post‑GA?
